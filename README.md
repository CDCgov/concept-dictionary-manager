Repository for the development of the Concept Dictionary Manager to support the SDP Vocabulary Service at https://github.com/CDCgov/SDP-Vocabulary-Service

# Running Locally

To run this service locally, be sure to have the latest version of Go installed. Downloads are available [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Then, clone this repository to your local system, or run `go get github.com/CDCgov/concept-dictionary-manager` to download the source to your `$GOPATH`.

Navigate to the directory of this repository, and run `go build` to build a binary version of the service and then run `./concept-dictionary-manager` to start the service.

The concept dictionary manager requires an elasticsearch instance loaded with codes using the phinvads sync utility found [here](https://github.com/CDCgov/phinvads-sync-util). In order to use the service api to search the codes in elasticsearch, you will need to have that running and populated as well. 

Running locally, it is advised to set a `$PORT` environment variable to run this service on a different port to avoid port conflicts.

To get a list of the available dictionary services, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8085/systems` (if you are running on port 8085).

To search the codes within the test system, navigate to `http://localhost:8085/concepts?system={codeSystem}&search={string}`, replacing {string} with a string you'd like to search for and {codeSystem} with the oid of the code system you would like to search. The value in the query string that populates `codeSystem` is resolved from the JSON you recieved from the `/systems` route.

# Running in an OpenShift Cluster

To run this service in an OpenShift cluster, use a go source-to-image builder (see [here](https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-go) for an example).

Point the source-to-image builder at this repository's URL on github.

Deploy whichever deployment and configuration of elasticsearch suits your needs.

Edit the deployment of this service to include the following environment variable:

`ELASTIC_SEARCH_HOST` - the hostname or IP address where elasticsearch is accessible. Include ports in this variable if necessary.

Once OpenShift redeploys this build, the service should be running and have access to elasticsearch.
